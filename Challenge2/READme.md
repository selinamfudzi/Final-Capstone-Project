## Challenge 2: Web Server Vulnerabilities

# Instructions
In this challenge, you must find vulnerabilities on an HTTP server. Misconfiguration of the web server allowed directory listing, which enabled the viewing of files and subdirectories through a web browser. Using reconnaissance techniques, you were required to locate the Challenge 2 flag file stored in a vulnerable directory.

## Step 1: Preliminary setup

a. Log into the server at 10.5.5.12 with the admin / password credentials.
